# To Do list

"To-do list" is a tool that helps to organize your day. It simply lists the things that you need to do and allows you to mark them as complete. I built a simple website that allows for doing that, using ES6 and Webpack!

I've been able to use Webpack to manage the files for front-end, using loaders for HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, in order to fix some special thing at the moment to use the front-end in a server.

This simple application allow user perform full basic CRUD operation using the local storage.
